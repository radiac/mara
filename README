cletus
======

Installation
------------

Installation is easy:
  python setup.py install

Alternatively, you may prefer to install it into a virtual environment:
  mkdir cletus
  virtualenv --clear --distribute cletus
  pip -E cletus install -e git+ssh://git@uzeweb.com/radiac-projects/cletus.git#egg=cletus


Running the server
------------------

To run a server:
  cletus run

If you installed it into a virtual environment, remember to switch into that first:
  cd cletus
  source bin/activate
  cletus run


Running the server as a daemon
------------------------------

The recommended method is using ``upstart``:
  http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
  
Chances are your linux distribution will at least support it, if not already
have it installed.

Create an upstart script 'cletus', (probably in /etc/init/ or /etc/event.d/):

  description "Cletus server for localhost:9000"
  start on runlevel [2345]
  stop on runlevel [!2345]
  respawn
  exec /usr/bin/cletus run

If you installed into a virtual environment, change the exec path to cletus:
  exec /path/to/cletus/bin/cletus

Customising this should be obvious; just change the description and exec lines
to reflect what you're doing.

You can then start and stop the process using upstart:
  sudo start cletus
  sudo stop cletus


Developer Overview
------------------

The cletus script in bin calls cletus.cli.run, which starts a core.Manager:

    manager = cletus.core.Manager(settings)
    manager.start()

That will initialise commands and plugins, then create a connection.Server,
which will in turn create each user.User as they connect.


self.settings = manager.settings;

The code is designed so that most changes can be achieved by creating plugins
or by subclassing Manager. For example, to add support for rooms you would make
a 'rooms' plugin, set the property on the user's plugin data, then subclass
Manager to make it check for rooms when listing or sending to users.


Writing plugins
---------------

Although plugins are in separate files, they share scope - a function defined
in one can be accessed in another.

They are loaded in alphanumeric order, depth-first; that is 10-mud/20-comm.py
will be loaded before 10-zoo.py.

The following variables will be available in the scope:

    manager     The manager object
    events      The events registry (manager.events)
    @listen     Decorator for functions which need to listen to events
    InputProcessor  The InputProcessor class


Events
------

Event objects have the following attributes:
    name        Name of the event
    handled     If a handler sets this to True, no more handlers will be called
    registry    The EventRegistry which raised this
    manager     The Manager instance

Events may also add their own attributes to the Event object - see below.

Events:

init            Called once all plugins have loaded
reload          Called when plugins are about to be reloaded (followed by init)
start           Server initialised but not yet listening

connect         A user has connected
                    user        User object
disconnect      A user has disconnected
                    user        User object
input           A user has sent input
                    user        User object
                    input       Line of input from user
poll            Called each server loop
shutdown        The server is about to shut down
